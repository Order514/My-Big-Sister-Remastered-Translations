Hello?

Is anybody there?

Please, I need your help.

Luzia, can't do this on her own...she needs you.

Are you going to help her or not?

Well?

Hurry up, you're running out of time.

You can't do it? Can you?!

You don't have what it takes!

Well? DO SOMETHING!

It's too late, there's nothing you can do now.

Thank you very much for playing my games! :D

It's nice to be in the real world once more!

It seems I was wrong. You are the smart one.

You helped Luzia escort me out of that god forsaken bathhouse...

and now that we're finally meeting, I would like to show you something special.

I can show you the real ending to this story.

Are you ready?

You must kill Yoko and save Sombria.

Good luck, the one behind the screen.

THE MARKETPLACE

I had that dream again

It's like a broken record

Going around and around

But I know a way.

One day...

I will break it.

Demo

A BAD DREAM?

And just like that...

Our lives would change, forever.

IS THIS ALL REAL?

But I don't need any help!

I'm fine! There's nothing wrong with me!

It must be her fault! She did this to me!

TAKEN

Don't worry...

Everything will be okay...

We'll get through this...

I promise.

ESCAPE?

W-What is happening to me?

Why can't I just be \"normal\"?

OF BLOOD AND WATER

She should've had her life ruined! Not me!

I don't deserve this, you do!

A LONG RIDE HOME

Heh, ya know...

this is kinda fun!

We should do this more often...but it's a little late now.

THE BUS STOP

It's kinda creepy out here...

but strangely farmilliar. I feel too comfortable.

COLD RAILS

We're almost home.

I can feel it getting closer.

But...

What will happen once we reach home?

Will everything go back to the way it was?

Will Luzia and I go back to the way we were?

Will I lose my sister...

Forever?

WAKE UP...PLEASE?

The valley of sorrows...

it shows us our worst realities.

I couldn't tell her the truth about what I saw.

It'll haunt me forever.

OUR LAST STOP

Well...this is it...

the end of the line.

I'm glad we grew closer, together.

We're all counting on you, Luzia.

BREAK OR STRENGTHEN

Home...just the way it was.

It's finally over.

Or is it?

The truth lies in the reflection of my name.

HAPPILY EVER AFTER

S-She did it.

Thank you, Luzia! I love you so much!

Thank you, Luzia.

We did it!

SECRET END

Early Access Checkpoint

Stranga Games says: Thanks for playing!

W-Wha? Where am I?

P-Please?

Anybody?

W-What are you doing here?

I need your help, Luzia.

Like I told you before, I don't need your help!

B-But I-

Just go away, Sombria!

Luzia...

Just go!

I-I'm sorry, Sombria...

we'll figure this out soon, I promise.

I can't open it.

The lock's broken!

Hello!?

Is anyone in there!?

I guess not.

It's a poster for a cola company.

\"Feel fresh with our new cola Buzz Blast\"

The bottle's stuck between her boobs.

ACH_BOOBPOSTER

They're old animal cages.

They smell horrible, like something died in-

Oh, the poor things.

Boiler Door Unlocked

Wait, there's something in there.

A key!

I can't reach it, my hands won't fit through the cage.

I could use somthing smaller and longer to reach them.

A little closer.

There! I wonder what you unlock, little key.

CoatHanger

Hey! Now there's something I can use!

There's nothing else useful in here.

It's pretty dark down there.

Wait!

I can see something shiny!

I need something to reach it, though.

Whoops! Almost dropped it!

I can use this to reach that shiny thing.

It's a flashlight...

this could be useful.

Well, I guess I don't need this coat hanger anymore.

It's unlocked!

You can keep the chopsticks darling.

Thanks!

MmmNoodles

Mmmm...

That smells delicious!

Hello there my child, are you lost?

I don't know...

I fell asleep...

the next thing I knew, I woke up here.

Are you hungry? Can I get you anything?

How about some of those tasty noodles?

I'm starving!

I insist...

here you are.

Mmmmmm, yum!

ACH_YUMMY_NOODLES

FishGuy

Excuse me?

Do you know where I am?

This is the Downtown Marketplace, why? Are you lost?

I'm not sure.

Where are your parents?

I'm not sure about that either.

Well, maybe you should just wait here...

it'll make it easier for them to find you.

I guess you're right.

Say, you haven't found a key, have you?

I dropped it around here somewhere.

Nope, sorry, Mister.

I-It's an air duct...

maybe I can find a way out through here?

It's pretty dark in there, though.

I'll need to find a light before I go in.

That's better! I can see where I'm going now.

I hope this'll help us find a way home.

Um, excuse me?

Yes?

I found your key, Mister!

Oh, thank you!

I thought I'd never find it.

A ha! Caught'ya! I could smell you a mile away!

Oh great, the smoke police.

You gonna tell mom?

No, as usual.

I can't sleep Sombie.

I told you before, stop calling me that!

Well, what do your friends call you?

Somba.

Pfft! That's stupid.

I like Sombie better.

It sounds like you're calling me a \"zombie\".

Do I look like a zombie to you?

Yeah, when your getting outta the shower.

Grr! Shut up, Luzia!

You look like a creepy doll!

Yeah, but you can still cuddle a doll.

I wouldn't want to cuddle a zombie.

*Sigh* Look, why can't you sleep?

I had that dream again....

Again? Which one?

The one where you were stuck in that marketplace...

What about that German singing alligator one?

*Sigh* Please...

I was trying to forget about that one, that damned song.

Nope, definately the marketplace one.

You mean the one where I'm like this \"ghost-like\" thing?

Yep!

Doesn't that bother you at all?

Why? It's your dream, after all.

But you're dead.

It's just a dream Luzia.

Whatever you say, Sombie...

just don't say I didn't warn you.

You worry too much, besides...

you better get back to bed, mom's gonna be home soon.

She'll get mad if you're up again.

Besides, it's cold out here.

Ok, Ok, I'm going to bed. Yeesh!

Why do I even bother sleeping?

I just keep having the same dream every god damn night!

The same freakin' dream!

*Sigh* Great!

Now I can't get back to sleep!

Better see what Sombie's up to.

Ok, lets get some sleep!

Ok...

this is not working!

WHY CAN'T I SLEEP?!

Oh, yeah! The lights!

Better turn them off.

Like duh.

That was quick, I didn't even leave the bed.

Maybe a fuse or something?

*Sigh* I'm gonna get in trouble for this, but...

MOM! MOMMY! THE LIGHT'S BLEW UP!

M-Mom?

I bet Sombie's just tryin' to scare me again.

SOMBIE! YOU'RE GONNA GET IT!

Sombria!?

Fine, I guess I'll just go and fix the lights myself!

Hmm, I think I'll go for a glass of milk!

That should help me sleep!

I can't sleep.

I hate that dream, so much...

Although, those noodles do sound delicious!

Only my mom's lucky screwdriver, which I don't need.

Weird place for a screwdriver? Shouldn't it be in a toolbox?

I always hated this picture, my bow is crooked and everything.

Where did I even get this bow from?

I better stay out of her room, she'd kill me.

Besides, it's locked.

Well, just a peek. She's not gonna mind.

Who am I kidding? She's gonna kill me!

Great! The boby pin broke anyway!

Huh? What's this? A photo?

I don't need to use it.

No internet on it anyway, it's for school work.

Y'know, I think I'll go for a glass of milk.

Uh, I'm twelve, dumb dumb!

Whatever, just hurry up and get to bed! Mom's gonna be home soon, and you'll be in trouble then.

Don't worry, I'll just tell her I was having a quick smoke before bed.

Okay, okay! Yeesh!

S-Sombie?

If this is some sick joke...

I bet she wants me to follow that trail of \"blood\", but guess what, I'm not dumb enough to fall for that!

She's hiding in the kitchen, I know it!

Go to bed, Luzia! Now!

Hey, Sombie. Did you draw this?

What?! Have you been in my room again?!

No, you dummy! I found it under your door.

It's kinda creepy.

Someone's been mailing them to us lately.

I don't know who it is but if it happens again I'm calling the cops.

It's really freaking me out.

Maybe it's burried treasure?

I would use this mug but Sombie's been slobbering all over it.

Yuck! Smells like cigarettes! How come mom hasn't noticed yet?

Sombie!

Sombria! Open up, I know you're in there!

Great, I'm gonna have to follow that trail.

I don't need to go to the bathroom.

Gee, I wonder why \"assface\" gets to stay up so late? She doesn't even do anything besides being annoying!

Maybe I should tell Mom she's smoking? Nah, that's probably a bad idea, she'll tell Mom about my Mr. Roachy.

I need to find a better home for it besides Sombie's underware draw.

Anyways, I better get back to bed.

I can't believe Mom kept that stupid cat drawing! I did that when I was three!

I should have drawn a tiger, much cooler!

RUN LUZIA! RUN!

Oh no!

So, Luzia...

what are we going to talk about today?

*Shrugs* I dunno.

How about we start with these reoccurring dreams?

Would you like to talk to me about the last one you had?

No...

Luzia, how can I help you if you're not going to open up to me?

Can I ask you something?

You can ask me anything, Luzia.

Why am I here?

You were diagnosed with a rare but bizarre mental illness, Luzia. That's why you're-

why am I really here?

All you want to talk about are my dreams...

maybe, it's not the dreams or the illness...

maybe, it's me.

Your dreams drive your illness, Luzia.

I think your sister's death is the key to your problem.

Sombie's not dead, though.

*Sigh*

Luzia, we've been through this. She's dead, you must accept it.

We need to make some sort of progress if we're going to make you feel better.

F-Fine, I'll accept it then.

Good! Finally! We made some progress.

You've finally come to accept your sister's-

No, I accept that she is still alive.

We may have to reduce your dosage, you could be having hallucinations.

I'll prescribe you with something a little less-

I haven't been taking them...

for weeks now.

W-Why not?

She is alive, it's true.

Luzia, this may be hard for you to understand, but it was you who found her body...

hanging, in her room.

You're lying!

The thing is...

It's ok, Luzia. It's-

Do you believe in the afterlife, Mr. Black?

Hmm, what do you mean by that, Luzia?

Like, ghosts, spirits?

Kinda.

Ghosts can't touch you...hurt you.

A poltergeist, maybe?

do poltergeist eat?

I don't see the need if they're already spirits of the dead.

Then why does Sombie eat?

And just what does she eat, Luzia?

Noodles!

Oh?

Oh, and people!

People?

Oh yes...

only when she's mad.

Well, that settles it. I think you're going to have to start taking your medication again.

Trust me, it'll help you, I promise.

It doesn't help, it makes things worse. I can't even remember the last time I saw you.

L-Let's try something, Luzia.

An exercise, I want you to find something in this room, any object.

It has to relate to how you feel right now.

Pick anything you want in this room and bring it to me.

I'll assess you afterwards.

Please, just be careful with the items...

I want to keep everything in one piece.

OK.

There's nothing here.

Ick, a brain...

I better take this, he'll think I'm smart or something.

DollChoice

Hey! A doll!

Maybe it's just me...

but dolls creep me the heck out!

So you brought me the doll.

Let's talk about that.

Please, take a seat.

So, why did you pick the doll?

It's cute I guess?

In a creepy sorta way.

Hmm, I can assure you it means more than just \"cute\".

This to me, means vulnerability.

Are you feeling fragile, Luzia?

Fragile? What's that supposed to mean?

Did your parents ever \"hurt\" you, or \"touch\" you in any wa-

What?! No!

She would never do such a thing! And I've never even met my dad!

Besides, mom's never home, she's always working.

What about your sister?

What the heck are you on about?!

First my mom, and now it's my sister?

Well, Luzia, you picked the doll.

I picked it because it was cute. I like dolls!

I'm not vulnerable, at least...I don't think I am?

You're holding back, Luzia.

It's ok to tell me, I want to help you.

*Sigh* There is one thing...

but I really don't like to talk about it.

My sister did-

Touch you? I knew it!

Finally! A breakthrou-

No, she didn't \"touch\" me, she...

did hurt me.

This is still a breakthrough! How did she hurt you?

S-She said I was adopted. That we're not really sisters...

and mom is not really my mom.

Is that all?!

Huh? What do you mean, is that all?

Luzia-

If Sombie was here right now she'd be eating you so fast-

Luzia, I think we're done here today.

...please...

I'll have the receptionist book your next appointment and please, take your medication.

See the lady at the desk on your way out.

ACH_DOLL

Hmm, the brain.

Interesting.

Why did you pick this?

Because I'm smart!

It's also all pink and squishy!

To me it means intellectuality.

You seem like a smart girl, Luzia.

Sombie thought so too...

a \"smart ass\".

*I can see why.*

Tell me something, if you're a smart girl...

why do you still insist your sister is still alive?

I-I...

look, I don't want to talk about her anymore.

We still have another twenty minutes left, Luzia.

I said, no more.

Don't do this again, don't waste my time, Luzia.

Remember what happened the last time you did?

*yes, I remember*

Now, can we please get back to your sister-

You can't do that to me anymore.

D-Do what, Luzia?

Hurt me.

W-What are you talking about? I don't hurt-

Touch me.

How dare you! I would never-

The medication helps me forget, remember?

L-Luzia? What's happened to your voice?

I don't think he get's it, Luzia.

I think it's time we show him...

what it means to feel \"dead inside\".

G-Get the hell away from me!

I'm sorry, Mr. Black...

I really am.

W-What's that sound?

W-WHAT IS THAT THING?!

That?

That's Sombria.

IMPOSSIBLE!

Told ya so!

STAY AWAY, PLEASE!

See, she's alive.

Now do you believe me?

Well? W-Wait, Sombie, what are you doing?

STAY AWAY!

Sombie! What the heck?! I only meant scare him!

Why'd you have to bite off his head for?!

God dammit!

ee wass hurrrrtinnnng youuu, Luzzzzia.

Please don't put the voice on, it's stupid.

You're not scary, Sombie.

Luzia, I'm always weak, tired, and extremely hungry.

I'm sorry, but I can't stand it! This body aches! The pain...is excruciating!

You're fine, Sombie.

Don't put yourself down.

Do I look fine to you? I'm a hideous creature!

I don't know if I'm dead or alive?

Well, at least you're out of your room finally.

THIS ISN'T FUNNY!

Well, it's better than being depressed?

You wouldn't know a thing about being depressed, Luzia!

I-I'm sorry, Sombie.

I just want to help-

You can't Luzia...

no one can.

What the hell's going on?

Great, now I can get outta here.

Feeling sick my darling?

You took your time in there.

I-It must have been something I ate for lunch.

Okay dear, see you next time.

I hope I don't see \"you\" anymore.

It's just a bunch of brochures for holiday parks.

Hey! This place doesn't look too bad.

What are you doing here?

I'm here just like everyone else.

I've got some problems I need sorting.

But what about you, my darling?

Taking your sister out to lunch?

Don't you have noodles to sell or something?

Don't you have a sister that needs you?

There's nothing I can do for her...

she doesn't want my help.

Pfft! That's what they all say.

What do you mean?

Do you think she want's you to ask you for your help?

Heh, but what do I know?

I'm just an old Lady, after all.

She doesn't want my help.

That doesn't mean she can't be helped...

put yourself in her position, then tell me how you feel.

It's not easy, is it? But it's not impossible either.

That word Sombie said before...

depressed.

Gosh!

I don't know why you're seeing this fool!

I should start my own clinic, and get outa the noodle business.

Is there a way to get out of here?

I need to help Sombria.

You're twelve, you're better figuring this out than me!

Besides...

the key to your problems are better off flushed away.

What's taking that man so long?!

I've been waiting for over an hour.

Wait, why didn't you show yourself to him!?

He think's I'm crazy!

It's not all just about you, ya'know-

Why do you look-

Why is this happening, Luzia?!

YOU RUINED MY LIFE!

I wish you were never born!

S-Sombie, I'm really sorr-

ENOUGH, LUZIA!

I WISH YOU WERE CURSED, JUST LIKE ME!

M-Maybe you're right...

you should have let me die.

Well, it's too late, little sister.

You can't change your mistakes.

She's right...

this is all my fault.

I keep making it worse.

Don't worry, Sombria.

I'll fix this...

Is that the door?

TherpyKey

Why is there a hand coming out of the toilet?

It's holding a key...

you've got to be kidding me.

I remember when my cousin Mark said he was eaten by a toilet once...

he's weird. Still...

that does sound quite terrifying.

I'll wash my hands later.

Nothing but trash.

So, where are we going?

I don't know, Luzia!

Stop asking me!

How can you be so calm about this?!

Easy! This has to be a prank!

A prank? You think this is a prank, Luzia?!

WE'RE BEING KIDNAPPED!

When is that going to sink into that stupid little head of yours?!

Well, what are we going to do about it?

There's nothing we can do!

The door's locked, there's no way out.

Pfft, sure there isn't.

Why are you still so chirpy about this?

*Sigh* Only thing left to do is see where they take us.

Who?

I don't know! I didn't get to see them beat me and stuff me in a moving truck, Luzia!

One was wearing a mask and the other...

What?

I thought I saw...

an old-

Hey! Do you hear that?

It sounds like music?

Where are we?

It sounds like...

Little Asia Town!

Little Asia Town?

We don't have any Asian towns near us, don't we?

I thought we did?

Mom's taken me there, that one time.

We must be in Little Tokyo.

I'm sure your mistaking this place for somewhere else.

Pfft! I'm sure is Little Tokyo.

Look, whatever. We need a plan to escape when that door opens.

I'll kick the guy that opens it and then we make a run for it, ok?

That's a stupid plan! It'll never work.

And why not?

That never happens in the movies...

the kidnapped people usually fall asleep before they arrive.

This isn't a movie, Luzia!

Feels just like one.

Why do I even bother?

*Sigh* Look, it'll work, trust me.

Whatever you say, sis.

Okay, let's get ready.

Hopefully, we'll be arriving soon.

FirstEnter

Well...

it's about time you showed up.

I apologize for the rough transportation.

You're both probably wanting an explanation?

Actually, why are you naked? Isn't it cold in there?

Heh. Aren't you a mischievous one.

Welcome, to my bathhouse.

What do you want with us?

Sombie, I wanna go swimming!

Shut up, Luzia! Now is definitely not the time-

Oh, but where are my manners?

I am Ashina...

but everybody just calls me \"The Red Witch\".

A witch?

You mean like, pointy hat, warts and, black cats?

*Small chuckle*

Your Luzia, right?

I've heard so much about you.

What do you want with us?!

Why did you bring us here?!

You wish to skip introductions? Fine.

I have a \"problem\", that I need help with.

It's been haunting me for a very, very long time.

And you, Sombria...are the key.

What! M-Me!?

The thing is, you have something that I need.

A chance.

A chance to end this nightmare.

You see, I was a lot like you.

We bare a striking resemblence, you and I.

So why is that? Fate? No?

I too were in the exact same position as yourself, without a choice.

To get what I wanted I had to make a sacrifice.

But did I get what I want? No.

I was stuck here, in these cold dark waters for all of eternity...

Until you came along.

So, Sombria. This...

is my sacrifice.

My curse.

No, freaking, way!

W-What do you want with me?

Heh, it's not what I want from you.

It's remarkable how much we resemble one another...

we are almost, identical, you and I. Like twins.

So, I would like to offer you a trade...

my body...for yours.

W-What?! No!

This all could be yours.The bathhouse, the power, the riches! All of it! Anything you wish!

She ain't gettin' your stilts, momma long legs!

You better let us go-

Wait! Did you say \"anything\"?

LUZIA!

Sombie, ask for a pony, please!

Just a really tall one!

Ha Ha! Sombria, I love your little sister!

Such a charming little child!

LUZIA, STOP IT!

Ok, ok. Forget it, lady!

Now, now. There's no need to be upset, it was just an offer.

You're more than welcome to decline, Sombria.

Then why did you kidnap us?

Strange. I don't remember asking for you to be kidnapped.

If it's who I think it is, she's in for a world of pain and suffering.

Sombria...

think about my offer, please.

I don't want to think about it!

I just want us to go home!

If that is all you want, I'll arrange a ride home for you both.

In the mean time feel free to enjoy the buffet, you must be hungry.

You got a buffet?!

All you can eat.

Ok, I'm sold.

C'mon, Sombie! Let's go chow down!

If only you girls knew. Especially you, Luzia.

Did I say you could be in my presence?

Surely a mother can visit her daughter?

You are no mother of mine, you old hag!

You gave me this wretched curse, and destroyed Tena's-

And you took my daughters for greed over some stupid man.

What do you want, filth?

Just a friendly word of caution.

I know what you're up to, Ashina. Especially with the child.

Like I said, you're here forever.

Just watch your back, you old, pathetic, woman!

She will free us all.

ACH_JUST_A_LITTLE_GIRL

Heh! My daughter, she will fall...

and when she does, you will all be mine.

You're wrong, you old crone.

I will have Sombria's body, I will leave this bath...

and I will finally have my cold dead claws around your neck!

*Tisk, tisk* My poor daughter, I'm sorry but you will never be free...

just like your friend, Tanto.

But I'm hungry, Sombie.

You always are!

I can't just stand here with an empty stomach!

I'm gonna go snoop around.

No! You stay right here!

Sorry \"mom\"! I can't do that.

I'm just going to explore in here, ok?

*Sigh* W-Whatever, Luzia. Whatever...

I'll bring you back a donut or something.

Hey, Sombie!

Can I have one of your hair pins?

Why?

My fringe is loose.

It looks fine, Luzia.

My back fringe, dummy.

Whatever, I don't care anymore. Just take it and leave me alone for a while.

That lady was freaky!

Not now, Luzia.

You think she can get my frisbee of the roof, Sombie?

I am not in the mood for this right now!

Pfft, fine. Hey, Sombie-

STOP CALLING ME THAT!

Ok, yeash! Sorry!

I didn't mean to make you upset.

N-No it's okay. *Sigh*

I'm scared, Luzia. I just want to go home.

There's a small hole in the wall.

I wonder what's in there?

Hmm, nothing.

So there are people working here...

and about time too, I'm starving!

You got rocks in that little head of yours? Didn't you hear me say \"No kids allowed in my kitchen\"!?

I did, but I'm a delinquent.

So, who are you?

*Sigh* This is why I hate kids.

The name's Nikuya, but the witch calls me \"The Butcher\".

I thought you were the chef?

I don't cook, well, not anymore.

Everything here is raw.

Oh, like sushi?

*Sigh* NO, not like sushi!

Do you know what witches eat?

I think my mom read me a book on that.

they eat gingerbread houses.

Kid, look, this isn't exactly a safe place for you to be in.

People, especially humans, go missing round here...

just be careful.

Gotcha...

but is there anything to eat around here?

*Goddammit* Look! I'll try and find you a candy bar or something, happy?!

Just hold still, silly billy! Let me pull the knife out-

I've been trying to pry open her lips so I can talk...

and now that I can-

WHY THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT FOR!!?

I can't believe you're still alive!

As I said be for, I'm already dead!

NOW I'M JUST A HEAD! YOU LITTLE DIP-

Sorry about that, but what the hell happened here?

*Sigh* She did this...

the lady who's not so on the wall anymore.

She broke free.

How?

Listen kid, there's no time to waste...

she's after someone named Sombria.

That's my sister!

Find her and get out while you still can!

She will kill you both if you stay here.

But I need that head you're wearing!

Listen kid, just get out! She is coming for you!

Look, I'm going to find Sombria...

just hang in there, and try not to lose your head- I mean her head!

What was that?! Some kind of joke?

...yes.

Oh good.

It's still here.

About time you showed up!

Can you let me down? I need to pick myself up!

Sorry I took so long.

*Sigh* Hey, look kid...

sorry about before, got a little tied up in my emotions.

You're so sweet for a man with no face.

Don't make me blush! Really, I'll kill ya! Oh! before I forget, I got you something.

It's over there, on the bench.

It's not much.

Yes! Some delicious noodles!

I knew there was something to eat around here-

I don't think roaches were in the recipe. *Yuck!*

I'll just take the chopsticks.

Excuse me, Mr. Butcher.

Have you met the lady on the wall?

Wait! How do you know about her?!

I used the knife you gave me to cut a hole in the wallpaper.

*Sigh* Why didn't I just kill her why I had the chance?

I should've just gutted'er like a fish...

but no, I gave her the damn knife! I could been somewhere far away from this shi-

*Sigh* Listen kid, stay away from her...

she's nothing but trouble.

Too late, Mr. Butcher.

*Sigh* Well, last time I played her little game she wanted an object or something?

Can't you just tell me how to get outta here?

What if the witch finds out? You're not the only one who'll be gutted, again.

Just do what the lady wants, she can take the blame.

If you wanna know more about the item to give her just bring it to me first.

I can shed some info on it for you.

Thanks! Oh, and by the way...

where's your face?

It's in my car, why?

I think you're lying.

Do I need one?

What are you?

Kid, you ask way too many questions!

Well, how about one more?

Can I have that big knife?

A little girl with a big knife?

I just got a chill down my spine, and I don't even have a spine.

No, it's mine.

Can't have everything we want, sorry, lil' creepy girl.

What if I find you a face?

Well, I wouldn't say no to one. I could use a face lift.

Hey! Mr. Butcher!

I have a surprise for you!

I found you a face!

Really? Who'd you steal it off?

You didn't cut someone's face-

Ta da!

Oh, a mask.

So, what do you think?

Honestly, it doesn't look half bad!

Thanks, kid!

So, can I have that knife now?

Sure, go nuts!

Just be responsible with it.

You don't wanna go round killin' anyone with it or anything. But why do I care. Enjoy!

Can you tell me a little more about this item?

Uh, I already know that.

Looks like my lunch, a dead traditional koi fish.

A very dead traditional koi fish.

I found it on the counter in the buffet.

Yep, that was my lunch.

Gross.

ACH_WHAT_IS_THIS

Hey! Be careful with that!

Do you have any idea what that is?

A flower?

Pfft! \"Flower\".

That's a spider lily, it resembles death, 

Cool name, but why is so dangerous?

It's used to kill spirits and demons in the afterlife...

and I've died far too many times to be touched by that thing for my liking.

Whoa! Is death painful?

Is death painful?

*Sigh* I just found something even more painful.

Well wadda ya know!

A pair of chopsticks?

Apart from them being very useful with cooking and eating, they are basically just to sticks.

Satisfied?

No.

Great! Now leave me alone!

Well, aren't you the life of the party.

I'm surprised you can fit in there with those long legs!

Wait! WHAT IS THIS?!

A trap!? You fool!

That won't stop me ripping the legs off you!

So now wha-

Shh!

Just go get the head and lets get the heck outta here.

I don't know how long this trap will hold.

Just lock the door.

You can't from the outside.

Who's there?

I can hear talking out there.

Pipe down in there, freak!

Wait, Luzia?

You two met?

Uh oh.

Luzia, go get the head now!

We'll meet back at the noodle lady's house!

Gross...

And really creepy.

D-Did you say something, my dear?

W-Wah? No way!

It's alive?

It?

I-U, uh- 

\"It\" is not my name...

I am known as \"The Lady On The Wall\".

And whom do I have the pleasure of meeting?

What is your name, my dear?

I-It's Luzia.

Hmm, strange name for a young girl.

My mom said it's a bright name.

Such a dark place to be in for one with such a...\"bright\" name.

Tell me Luzia, why are you here?

We were kidnapped by the witch in the bath and-

We?

There's someone with you?

Yeah, my sister, Sombria.

Heh...

How ironic, the opposites. Light and Dark.

Tell me, did the witch make either of you an offer?

Well, not to me...

she did to Sombie though.

I knew it! Trying to escape your wretched curse now, are you?

I don't think so, we're just waiting for our ride home.

She's not letting you leave, Luzia...

but I may be able to help you, both.

Okay, how?

I'll make you a deal...

You bring me something that I want and I'll tell you how to escape, deal?

Okay, that sounds fair.

However, if you bring me something that I don't want...

then you will nourish my withing body with yours, deal?

Wait, what?! No way, lady!

I could just eat you now? Save me the trouble of waiting.

But I'm feeling generous today, so, bring me something of...

Usefulness.

Oh, would you look at that!

Such a lifeless, greasy body. A dead fish...

Looks like you made the right choice.

I shall help you, but just this once.

You need to find the secret passage somewhere in the bathing room.

You'll need this tile plus one other to activate the passage.

You should hurry if you want to save your sister...

and...I'm also getting quite hungry.

*Tisk,tisk* You dissapoint me, Luzia.

But you won't dissapoint me stomach.

Such a deadly flower, such beauty.

The table is broken.

Hey! S-She's...gone!

Not good!

Wait, what's this?

You...took my legs, my looks, my...life. [ I will never forgive you for what you have done to me! [ You shall all choke on your thick greedy blood.

I need to warn Sombie.

There's something else here...

a key? I wonder what it's for?

Luzia, I'm so glad you could join us.

You let her go!

LUZIA! JUST RUN! GET OUT OF HERE!

You're not going anywhere.

You might just make it out alive.

I'm not leaving without my her!

Luzia, I admire your bravery...

but seriously, what are you going to do?

Something you'll regret if you lay one finger on her!

You mean...like this?

*Gasp* SOMBRIA!!!

Heh, whoops! Sorry, Luzia...

but she's mine now.

WHAT DID YOU DO TO SOMBRIA!

Something that was done to me, a long time ago.

Once complete, I'll be taking her body as my own, she'll remain here...

You will stay here with the others.

CHANGE HER BACK!

The changes are...permanent, Luzia.

She is no longer your sister but a portal to my salvation!

Y-You're wrong...

Luzia! Lets go!

We can escape through this pipe in the water.

I can't leave now.

Not without the head.

It's!!

Another key...

This one must belong to the buffet door!

It's locked now?

Maybe there's a key around here, somewhere?

BloodWater

Oh my gosh!

What the hell happened here?

We were literally gone for a few hours...

w-who did this?

but I have a feeling we're about to find out.

So, where is the head?

I think it's in the secret bathroom.

I'll go check there, you look around here.

We'll meet up in the sauna room if anything happens.

Be careful.

How does she vanish like that?

So cool!

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

Please, just don't say anything right now...

leave me alone.

But you always want to be alone!

Well, I can't be alone when you're around!

Why is this happening to me?

What did I do to deserve this?

This must be the way out of here.

But it's locked.

I'll have to find a key.

Just because I'm dry, doesn't mean I want to jump back in.

More dead animal cages floating in there.

There's a door on the other side.

I don't think I can jump that gap.

Maybe, I could make a bridge.

I hope this holds.

I don't want to get wet again.

Eww gross!

Sewer water, yuck!

Hey! There's something shiny in there.

Hmm, I ain't sticking my hand in there.

I'll need to fish it out somehow.

FindMetalPole

Hopefully that shiny thing is made out of metal.

Well, it worked!

It's a metal pipe.

Maybe I can find a use for it.

I could use this plank of wood to make a bridge.

It looks pretty old though.

I just hope it doesn't break.

There's nothing else in there.

There's something glimmering in there...

but I ain't sticking my hand in to find out.

I'll need something long to reach it.

FindString

This'll save me using my hand.

Some fishing line?

What kind of fish would you catch down here?

Okay, let's make a fishing pole.

There's some sort of metal cable floating in the water.

I could fish it out if I had a fishing pole.

I still can't reach it with the pole...

but I could make a fishing pole if I had some string...

and a hook.

There you are! Mr. Gate Key!

Let's get out of here.

We can get outta here!

Just go without me, Luzia...

leave me here.

Pfft, I knew you were going to say that!

Look Sombie, I don't know what the witch lady did to you...

but we can fix it, we can't just give up.

There must be a way to change you back!

I-I don't know, Luzia.

You won't unless you try, Sombie.

But the witch, she's dead...

how are we going to change me back?

Maybe someone else knows? Lets go ask around!

Ok, and thanks, Luzia.

I should say it a lot more but it's hard, y'know?

No dough, no noodles!

Who you callin' little?!

You're shorter than me!

So clichÃ©.

It's a laundromat.

I could use some clean clothes right about now.

Explaination

I'm looking for someone who can help my-

Sorry, little one. I'm really busy with this mess.

Do you know anyone who can help me?

I think my sister is cursed.

Hmm, you should find Yoko.

She's an expert on such things.

Yoko?

Where can I find her?

Well, my friend usually sees her in the laundromat, washing her blankets.

But for some reason, some wise-ass locked the gate to the laundromat and has the key.

Explaination2

What's wrong with your sister?

I think she's sick?

Oh my, that's not good.

What kind of sickness does she have?

Something that makes you pale, with really long arms-

That sounds more like a curse to me.

I thought so.

You didn't meet a witch by chance? Did you?

Maybe.

Well, the only person I know that could help you is Yoko.

She's also known as the \"Noodle Lady\".

Noodle lady?

Yeah, she's like an expert on curses n' stuff.

So where can I find her?

She's usually in the laundromat, washing her underwear.

Really? I need to was my undies too!

Probably the rest of my clothes too.

No offence, but you smell like you need a wash in general.

It's not like I went swimming in a sewer or anything.

Did you?

That's gross!

Ok, seeya!

Find the noodle lady.

She can help your sister.

You're worse than that Tanto guy!

Look, mister...

Give me one, and I'll show you.

Nice try!

Maybe you should eat some fruit for once! Much healthier!

Ya know, I could eat an apple right about now.

I'll tell you what, you find me an apple and I'll give you the gate key to the laundromat, deal?

*Sigh* Fine...

but if you don't, I'll make you choke on that apple.

It's a deal, then!

Thanks for the apple.

You can unlock the gate to the laundromat with it.

I better head to the bathhouse.

why are you here?

I said I'll do this on my own.

Well, I figured you might need the key to get in.

We ain't gonna find the witch's head standing here.

I've been expecting you...

And I've been expecting you...

...old woman.

You don't even know who I am, do you?

No, no I don't.

Heh, but you may remember me.

Wait a minute!

You're the noodle lady from my dreams!

Oh my!

You're all wet and smelly!

Why don't you call your sister and tell her to come here.

I'll pay for your clothes to be cleaned.

Thank you, that's really nic-

Wait! How do you know that I have sister?

I know a lot about you and your sister, Luzia.

I'm here to help you.

I never asked for your help, old lady.

I think you were just about to, deary.

You're not another witch, are you?

Come on young one...

lets get you out of those wet clothes.

Wait, what will I wear? I can't just stand here naked!

I wouldn't worry about that, my dear.

There's only one other person who uses this laundromat...

and she only comes in on Tuesdays.

So tell me girls...

fine weather we're having, no?

Not a cloud in the night sky.

Actually, it's a little cold.

Huh...

it must be Tuesday.

Oh? You girls are back?

You look surprised to see us?

Well with the Lady running around, I was sure you'd be done for.

Are you spying on us?

Word travels fast around the slums, hun.

C'mon, don't bullshit me, old lady!

Luzia! Watch your language!

Hey! You're not in charge of me anymore!

Monsters can't be babysitters!

Ouch.

Shut up, Luzia! You're the real monster!

Oh how I've missed this.

How could you miss this?

I have to live with this little brat every day!

I look like a freak because of her!

I still remember when my daughters used to get along so well.

All they ever do now is fight for centuries...

just like you two.

Wait! Centuries?

How old are you?

How old do you think I am, Luzia?

A hundred, maybe?

Huh, must be the hair.

Eighty?

You can keep guessing, you'll never get it.

How can the witch- I mean, your daughter, look as old as me?

We're in the spirit world, young lady.

Age means nothing here.

So we don't age?

Really?

You could be a thousand years old and have the complexity of a child.

We are stuck in an endless limbo, until me move on to the planes above.

However, there are those who wish to return to where they once came...

just like Ashina.

Wait, you can go back?!

We can go home?!

There is ways to do it, but it takes a lot of complex-

C-Can we fix my condition, first?

Yes, of course.

Now that we have my daughter's head...

I can use her blood to make a cure for the curse.

All you need to do is drink it.

It'll take some time to work but once it does, it should change you back to your old self.

So how does it work?

It'll break the loop of the curse, what it does is-

Just get to the point, old lady!

This is a complicated curse Luzia.

Once Sombria drinks the antidote, she will have only 3 days to return home.

Otherwise...you will be stuck in the curse's loop forever.

For ever?

You mean Sombie, right?

S-Sure.

Just remember...

that when the time comes, you will have to make a choice.

Just tell me what I have to do.

Heh, just drink this and go home.

That is all.

Wait, really?

That's it?

No magic spells, voodoo or rituals?

That sounds too easy.

It does, doesn't it.

I can assure you that it is much more complicated behind the veil.

Once you both return home...

it shall be broken.

So how do we get home?

We were kidnapped in the back of a truck!

I have no idea where we are or what this \"spirit place\" is?

I know someone who can take you as far as the countryside...

but from there you will need to return on your own.

There's a bus route that can get you as far as the Chikara express train line.

Here are some tickets for the bus and the train.

Now get some rest, you leave in the morning.

Oh, before I forget...

did you remember to lock the bathhouse doors when you were done?

U-Uh, whoops!

NoodleCutscene

You were kidnapped?

Yeah, and they beat up Sombie too!

That settles it, she has gone too far this time!

Uh, who has?

Well, it's about time I introduced myself.

I am Yokona Kagami...

But everyone just calls me Noodle Lady.

Let me guess, it's because you sell noodles?

I own the Ramen shop next door.

I see you both have met my daughter, Ashina.

The witch is your daughter?

This is perfect! You can help Sombie!

Right?

Hmm, by the looks of things it may be too late for her, Luzia.

You mean I'll be stuck like this forever?

My dear, I hate to be the one to tell you this but, you're dead.

I'M DEAD?!

But she's standing right there!

Sombria, place your hand over your heart.

Do you feel a beat?

THERE'S NO BEAT! I'M DEAD!!

WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO ME?!

By the looks of things you're now a Yokai Sombria.

What's a Yokai?

A yokai, a ghost, spirit, whatever you want to call it...

well actually, maybe poltergeist is probably a better term.

It seems Ashina wanted something from you but what exactly?

S-She wanted to swap bodies.

Hmm, looks like it didn't go all to plan.

Something went wrong as you've turned into one of us.

One of you? You still look human!

I look like a hideous creature!

You just look like a human, only with long arms and pale skin.

And no legs, what happened to those?

Anyway, you look fine, Sombie.

Where is Ashina now?

She's dead, I think.

Her head was floating in the bath.

Dead?! Ha! Serves her right!

Wow really? I'd really hate to have you as a mom.

I think Sombie killed her.

Well this is certainly some good news!

Good news?

We may be able to reverse the curse.

Reverse the curse? How?

All we need is some of Ashina's blood.

So if you both are able to retrieve her head then-

Um, how about NO!

I never want to set foot back in that place again!

Don't you want to help your sister?

I do, but isn't there another way?

I'll go.

Wait, Sombie...

You've done enough, Luzia.

I need to fix this myself.

I love it when sisters squabble.

Don't you, Luzia?

Yeah, whoopie.

What are you waiting for?

Go after her.

She obviously doesn't want my help.

They never do...

so why wait for an invitation?

Huh, you're right, old noodle lady.

Besides, I've probably pissed her off enough for one day.

Here's the spare key to the bathhouse, I keep it incase of emergencies.

Thanks.

Good luck, little one. You're gonna need it.

So explain to me again...

why are we riding with the door open? Isn't it a little dangerous?

Just look at that view!

Look at the never-ending line of fences!

It's breathtaking...

It's nauseating, I think I'm gonna *ugh*...

the smell of cows isn't helping.

Ha! They smell better than you right now!

*Sniff* I don't notice anything?

It's a proven fact you can't smell yourself.

No it isn't.

Then how come you can't smell your own farts?

You're an idiot.

It's true!

Everybody else can smell mine, except me.

That's because you leave the room right after you do one!

Nah, I think it's fart magic.

Speaking of magic...

did you take that magic potion?

It's not a magic potion, it's an antidote...

and yes I did.

I would have taken it when I got home.

Didn't the old noodle lady said it would go off in a few days?

Yes but it shouldn't take us that long to get home, I think?

Two days. I remember her saying something about that this morning...

and some mumbo jumbo about breaking the \"loop\".

Loop? What loop?

Loop of the curse, I don't know. I wasn't paying attention.

Actually, there was one thing she did say before we left.

Hmm?

T-That I should...

*ugh* enjoy my time with you.

Ha! That's easy! What's not to enjoy?

I'm always fun, baby!

Whatever.

And I'm smoke free!

Rubbing it in, huh?

You know what? We're not fighting, right now.

she was right.

This is kinda enjoyable.

*Deep breath* I can't get enough of that stank, cow fart infested air!

Annnd there it goes. Enjoyment gone.

Heh, you're a weird girl Luzia.

So much for the truck ride.

Just be thankful it got us this far.

Where are we anyway?

It looks like a bus stop.

Congratulations, Luzia...

you won a cookie.

Gimme! I'm starving!

All I ate was a dead fish I found in the buffet!

Please tell me that didn't happen?

I stole it from that faceless guy.

I can't believe we're even related.

I was being sarcastic about the cookie, Luzia.

Damn.

This bus sure is slow.

Well, I'm bored.

Oh no, you're not wandering off again!

Please?

The last time you wondered off I turned into this hideous creature!

Do you really think I'm going to let that happen again?

This time, you stay here...

I'm gonna go see if I can find someone  around here, maybe they'll have some food...I'm hungry too.

You too?!

J-Just wait here, I can smell something...

Call out when the bus arrives.

Huh, so this is what it feels like.

FindSombieFood

Hey! A mushroom!

I could eat it.

If I were desperate, looks poisonous.

Mushroom2

I hope this helps her.

IntroCutscene:Forest

Here you go, Sombie.

This'll keep you dry.

Please tell me you didn't just do that.

A leaf? This is going to keep me dry?

Yep.

I feel silly.

You look silly.

So, find anything interesting in there?

Nothing out of the ordinary.

After everything we've seen, what is ordinary?

We should probably stand under the bus shelter.

I like the rain.

It is peaceful, but we're probably gonna catch a cold.

What's gonna happen with us? When this is all over?

I, I don't know...

it'll all go back to normal, I hope.

Even us?

The fighting, the arguing...stuff like that?

Oh! Well, we don't have to...

it all depends.

On what?

On how much you owe me after this.

I have a feeling that I'm never gonna hear the end of this, once we get home.

Oh, you better believe it sister!

Fantastic!

Yep! I'm gonna remind you every day...

about how you saved my life.

So, you're not mad at me?

I was never mad at you, Luzia.

When you get older things become more complicated...

sometimes, I wish I could be as young as you again.

But we can't go back...

we need to keep moving forward...

and if I stay mad at you...

I won't be going anywhere.

I get what you mean.

I thought you never would-

Just promise me one thing.

Please, quit smoking. You're stinking up the whole house!

We'll see, Luzia. Depends on how much of a brat you'll be towards me. Heh.

H-Hey! Is that the bus?

ACH_NEIGHBOR_SOMBIE

Where's the bus?

BusReady

It hasn't arrived yet?

Nope.

So, find anything in there?

After everything we've seen, what's ordinary anymore?

It's nice.

what will happen with us, when this is all over?

it'll all go back to normal, I guess.

The fighting, the arguing, stuff like that?

I have a feeling that I'm never gonna hear the end of this once we get home.

Oh, you better believe it sister.

Yep! I'm gonna remind you all the time, about how you saved my life.

So, you're not mad at me anymore?

Once you get older things become more complicated...

We can't go back...

W-Well, good!

Heh, we'll see, Luzia.

Saving won't help you now.

I brought you this.

Ah! Noodles!

Delicious.

Wait, before I go...

why does everyone loves noodles so much?

B-Because they're delecious!

Do you know what makes them more delecious?

Wild mushrooms.

Here, take this. It'll give your noodles a bit of a kick in flavor!

Not everything is as it seems...

when the time is right...

choose wisely.

ACH_SPIRIT_NOODLE

Whoa!

W-Who is that?

Uh, hi!

My name is Luzia-

I know who you are.

You do?

I swear we haven't met.

We didn't have to, I just know.

Why have you come here, young Luzia?

Because I'm hungry.

Besides that, I mean why are you really here.

We're stuck while wating for the bus to take us home...

and I'm still hungry!

Hmm, seems like you and Sombria are in a bit of a mess.

Yes, we are-

Wait! How did you-

I am Wiji!

I am the spirit of the forest!

I have seen many things in my time amongst the trees...

but I must admit, I'd never thought I'd see you again.

Again?

What do you mean again?

Hmm, it seems like you have forgotten...

such a strange anomaly.

Tell me, are you planning on breaking your \"loop\"?

Enough with this loop business!

First, the noodle lady, now Sombri-

Noodle Lady?

Yes, the old woman. I can't seem to remember her name though.

Yoko, something.

Yokona Kagami.

Yeah that's it!

Seems like their plan didn't work after all.

Young Luzia, you must listen to me very carefully...

...To end it all.

Wait, what does that mean? I'm gonna die?!

We will see, young Luzia. Good luck.

Sombie?

The pain, the hunger...

p-please, help me.

O-Ok...

just wait right here.

I'll find you something to eat.

*Ugh* Hurry!

Please help Luzia.

Maybe she could eat this.

Well, it's better than nothing.

Please...

Bring me more.

I feel much better, much...stronger.

But, you shouldn't have left the bathhouse.

Luzia, you are in great *Ugh* dange- *Ugh*

AHH!

What the heck is going on?

Oh, my, GOSH!

I can see my own butt!

Luzia! What is happening?!

I have absolutely no idea, Sombie.

Hang on a second.

I think I can fix-

OH NO!

THAT POOR DEER!

What happened?!

Uh...I think you had Bambs for lunch Sombie.

I-I did this?

What is wrong with me?

Look Sombie, we should really be heading back to the bus stop.

I'll wait for you there.

I can't just leave her like this.

I need to help Sombie first.

Mudo will give girl something if you bring Mudo...

Everyone else is just too big!

Well, when you put it that way I guess you're right.

What's in the bowl? You adorable little thing, you!

So, why is little girl here in the woods?

For the noodles, duh.

What is duh noodles?

What's your name, little guy?

Everyone just calls me Little Jacket.

No problem, LJ.

You're just so cute!

I could just take you home!

Hmm, maybe I could-

I-I'm fine, thank you strange girl!

One bowl please!

Hello, young one.

You're a little far in the woods to be-

I said, one bowl please!

Well, you must be hungry.

I am.

Then please, take a bowl of noodles.

That was good!

In exchange, could I ask a favor?

Sure!

Could you please take a bowl and place it by the shrine...

it's for someone, special.

Thank you, young one.

Now this is the way to travel!

A truck, a bus, now a train?!

What's next?

An airplane?!

No way!

Nope! Forget that!

Why? What's the matter?

Afraid of heights?

I'm not worried about being up in the sky.

I used to have dreams about being on a plane.

What happened?

Well, I went to the bathroom...

and when I came back everyone was gone!

Everyone, it was just me.

That's a pretty crazy dream.

Perfect!

That's all I can think about right now!

Remember when uncle Robert tried fixing mom's microwave?

He forgot to unplug it.

Heh, some engineer he is! Too bad he disappeared.

Whatever happened to aunt Claire and cousin Mark?

She died, Luzia. As for Mark, I have no clue what happened to him. I think he went to a foster home.

Really? Why didn't he come live with us?

You're already a handful.

Besides, I think it's for the best...

I couldn't imaging the amount of mental problems that boy would have with all that's happened to him.

Yeah, it's pretty sad...

*Sigh* I miss home.

So do I.

I miss mom too.

Pfft! I don't.

She was never home.

I get that being a nurse is hard work...

but we need attention too!

What's with you, Luzia?

These things shouldn't matter to a twelve year old.

You don't seem like yourself anymore.

I don't even feel like myself...

I feel as if this has all happened before...

like I'm living someone else's life, y'know?

I'm not me.

You get what I mean?

I do...

I haven't felt myself since the kidnaping.

I guess we share the same feelings.

You know what else is weird, though?

Where the heck is everyone?

The train's empty!

There was no one on the bus either.

I'm gonna take a look around.

Okay, I'll take a look too.

If something happens, we'll meet up in the bathroom.

Ok, we'll-

The bathroom?

For privacy.

Don't want anything else going astray now, don't we?

Ok, just make sure you're not actually using it when I come in.

For crying out loud, Luzia.

Who's crying, now?

SombieTrainBathroom

JESUS! SOMBIE!

You scared the hell outta me!

I thought you weren't scared of anything?

Only by spontaneous surprises!

I'll remember to leave a sign on the door next time.

So, did you find anything?

I met the train driver.

What did he say?

Just some really weird stuff.

Well what?

Do you think this is all a dream?

A dream?

Am I really Luzia?

Only for as long as I've know you.

You're sounding really weird right now, Luzia.

Maybe, I don't know?

There's something not right in the back of my mind...

I'm just not sure what it is...

like we're being set or something.

C'mon, cheer up, Luzia.

We need to make it home!

Let's stay focused.

I'll go talk to the driver.

You check the back of the train.

Oh, I also found this keycard...

not sure what it's for, it didn't work on any of the doors...

maybe you can find a way to use it.

I'm just visiting an old friend in the city.

Yeah right, like I'd believe that!

You don't look very pleased to see me, hmm?

I'm just worried about Sombie. The creepy killer lady is after her!

She may even kill her.

Not unless I can help it!

Hmm, just be careful, Luzia. You're life is worth far more than your sister's

What?! Mine is worthless without hers!

I need to find her.

You need to stop, Luzia.

I think you're lying, little man.

Little Jacket needs a keycard to unlock this door.

Little Jacket can crawl through the vent and unlock it from the other side.

Anything?!

S-She's after s-someone named...

Oh? And how do you know how to unlock it?

I have a keycard!

Is this what you need?

Hmm, it looks like it could work.

Little Jacket will try.

Wait here.

Gosh! Thank you! You adorable little thing!

Little Jacket will lock the door if you say that again.

Whoops! I mean thank you!

What the hell is that!

I'm sorry little girl, no passengers allowed back here.

Who are you?

Me? N-No one ever takes notice of me.

Everyone just calls me Stretch.

I just deal with the passenger's luggage.

But where are all the passengers?

I-I don't know. I'm not permitted to leave this room.

How long have you been here?

W-Well, as long as I can remember.

Why do you want to know Miss....

Luzia, my name is Luzia.

P-Pleased to meet you, Luzia.

Please, there's no need to be shy.

I-I'm sorry.

I don't mean to be shy.

It's just, I-I've heard a lot about you.

Tell me, are you still trying to break the curse?

You mean the loo- Wait!

How do you know about that?!

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you upset.

Please, tell me what you know about me. PLEASE!

I-I can't.

All I can say is that old lady said a lot about you.

She also said bad things may happen if I talk to you.

Please, forgive me.

Bad things!?

You're literally a walking head!

Bad hit you a long time ago, pal!

Excuse me, Mr. Gustoph?

Well, if it isn't little Luzia!

What can I do for you?

I'm wondering if you had seen my sister?

Hmm, I dunno. What does she look like?

A tall, ghost-ish looking girl with long arms!

That is the most freakish description I've ever heard!

But yes, she did come through here.

Lookin' for you as a matter of fact!

Did she say where she was going?!

She said she was going back to her seat to wait for you.

B-But that's impossible!

I would have seen her!

Maybe you walked straight past her, without noticing?

N-No, I don't think so.

Nothing ever gets past me!

And nothing gets past Gustoph too...

because he takes up the entire doorway!

HA!

Are you sure you saw her?

I'm sure I did, little one.

A ghoulish girl with long arms is pretty hard to miss.

Goulish?

Yes, goulish, or ghost-ish.

Something like that.

She did seem quite happy to see me though.

I think we both are.

Before you go, could you please check on my buddy, Stretch?

Haven't heard from him in a while now.

If you haven't hurt his feelings already!

I-I think I did...

where does he like to hide?

He should be in the luggage compartment somewhere.

Always waiting to take someones luggage.

The poor guy.

Okay, I'll go find him.

MeetGustoph

Sorry to interrupt.

Can I-

*Whistling* ...Oh!

Hello there, little one!

Who? Me?

Well, I'm the guy who drives this train, of course!

And what I wanna know is...

how the heck did you get in here?

I found a keycard in the bed carriage.

So that's where I left the darned keycard!

Excuse me but, who are you?

They call me Gustoph! But you can call me Gus.

And you must be Luzia?

How do you know my name?!

I know everything!

Plus, it's in the passengers log book.

Gotta keep a head count on all who ride the rails!

Even if they don't have a head!

How many people are on the train?

Hmm, let me see...

Just one!

Just one!?

But what about my sister?!

Your sister?

You only said how many people, little one.

She's a person too, y'know!

Ho Ho! I'm sure she was!

So, you on holiday?

No, but I sure'll need one after all this.

Been in a bit of a pickle have we, missy?

You can say that again.

I can't believe we're finally on our way home to end all of this mess.

Well, I'm glad it all worked out for ya.

Sure thing, little one.

Where's the rest of the passengers?

Ha Ha! The rest of the passengers!?

Why, they're all around you!

Can't you see them?

Well, no I can't.

They're probably just shy...

or maybe they're scared of something.

Scared? Of who?

You'd best be gettin' back to your cabin, little missy.

Once we're in the valley of sorrows, you don't wanna be wonderin' around.

But come see me later! If you're still alive, that is!

Alive?!

H-Hey, Sombie. Are you okay?

What home?

What do you mean? Our home.

So what, it's not like it's gonna change anything.

Of course it will!

Please, don't give up on me now!

Luzia, do you remember what happened before this all happened?

...n-no.

What do you remember about mom?

Well, not much...

she was never around.

I guess it's because she was too busy working at the hospital-

Luzia, we don't have a mother.

Y-Yes we do! What do you mean by-

She's not our real mother. We were both left on her door step when we were born...

we're not even real sisters.

I've been lying to you this whole time...

I-I'm sorry...Luzia.

*Sniff* P-Please, tell me this is a joke, right?

It has to be!

I'm sorry.

*Sniff*I don't know who to trust anymore?!

For the first time in my life...

...I feel empty inside.

Luzia, please-

Hey!

Little one!

Come here, quick!

Huh? Gus?

Sorry little one, but I couldn't help over hearing your conversation.

What's it matter anyway?

You don't believe that garbage, do you?!

What did I tell'ya earlier? Hmm?

U-Uh, I forgot.

Well, at least we're out the other end.

End of what?

Ho Ho! The valley!

I see the valley of sorrows has affected your mind!

The valley of sorrows?

When the train passes through the valley, your worst fears become a reality.

So it was all a dream?

Sort of, my tiny friend.

More like a vision.

So, none of it was real?

See, that's the thing, it could be real.

But the valley will always show the worst outcome.

Fire away little Missy!

What do you see when you go through the valley?

Heh, Y'know, nobody's ever asked me that before...apart from one other.

What I saw was how I ended up here. I crashed my train...

killing all but one passenger...

...me.

It's not your fault, little missy...

it's mine.

Strange, you remind me of someone I used to know.

This is going to sound even stranger...

but I remember you.

I remember a cabin in the misty woods...

I just can't remember anything else.

...Ash?

No, it's can't be.

How did you die?

I-In my home...

I thought I could drink away the pain.

Instead, I made it worse...

once I had joined my passengers...

I could finally understand, what it felt like to be let down...

they depended on me.

It wasn't your fault, Gus.

These things happen.

We don't control life...

life controls us.

Are you sure you're the little girl I spoke to earlier?

You sound a lot like someone else I used to know.

I don't know what is happening to me.

Whatever it is, I feel it's almost consumed me.

Like, I'm finally about to wake up.

Well, you are truly remarkable, little one.

How is Stretch doin'?

H-He, didn't make it.

Poor kid.

It's okay little one.

He's arrived at his final station.

Speaking of which!

Don't I?

I wish none of this ever happened!

I wish...I never...

Killed her.

HEY! GIRL!

!!!

What are you doing out here little guy?

Little Jacket couldn't help but overhear little girl.

Little Jacket wants to know why little girl is screaming?

\"Little girl\" does have a name, ya know?

Little Jacket already knows Luzia's name!

What Little Jacket doesn't know is; why is Luzia upset?

Because, I don't know if I'm myself anymore?

I act differently, I've been fighting with Sombie more...

I feel like I've done something really bad...

I just have no idea what I've done.

This reminds Little Jacket of a story.

A story called \"Two Birds One Stone\".

\"Two Birds One Stone\"?

You haven't heard of \"Two Birds One Stone\"?

Ok, Little Jacket will tell you, so listen up!

Once upon a ti-

Is this going to be a long story?

SHHH!

Okay, okay! Go ahead.

Once upon a time, there were two sisters that lived in the country-side.

They were the best of friends and did everything together.

They were so close that they liked and enjoyed the same things...

especially this one man.

However, the man only had eyes for one of the sisters...

the taller one.

Younger sister was so upset by this that she tried everything she could to be taller.

So, younger sister got a witch to use magic to make legs longer, just like older sister.

Witch said, needs older sister's legs to make potion.

In order for the witch's magic to work, she had to cut off older sister's legs...

and she did in her sleep.

Younger sister got what she wanted but was also given a curse.

Wait! I've heard this before...

I remember something...about a theater.

You should remember, Luzia.

Because you're the-

Wait, what's that sound?

Ah! Hello, Luzia.

Nice to finally see you again.

YOU ATE HIM! YOU ATE THE LITTLE GUY!

Oh, I'm sorry. He looked like the perfect snack.

You see, I'm very hungry Luzia.

I have been for centuries...and I still am.

WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME!?

Oh? You think this is about you?

HA HA!

No my little friend.

I'm here to see my sister!

I know she's on this train.

Sister?

Yes, the one you call \"Sombria\".

WAIT!

She's my sister!

She was your sister.

When I find her, I'm going to break those god damn legs of hers!

You're not laying a finger on her, you ugly lady!

Not just one finger but all of them. Right around her throat!

Once I kill her, you're next...

mother.

This looks like some sort of entertainment stage.

S-Sombie!?

I-I-

What's wrong?!

Hello, Luzia.

It's you! The witch!

Give me back my sister!

Luzia, I don't have much time.

You need to listen to me.

Why should I listen to you?!

Look what you did to Sombria!

Your sister is fine, Luzia.

Trust me.

Then why did you do this?

It's the only way to end this, to end the loop.

The curse loop?

You may be still too young to understand but you and I are closer than you think.

This isn't the first time we've met.

I need Sombria's body to-

So you stole my sister's body!

Do you think it's okay to steal other people's bodies?!

Luzia, you don't understand. Please, listen-

I don't have to!

This is your problem not ours!

Turn my sister back now!

I can't...

not until the curse has been lifted.

Then how do I lift the curse?!

You have to break the loop, Luzia.

We are already on our way to break the loop!

You've been tricked...

once you reach home, you will restart the loop. You'll ruin everything!

That's not true!

The Noodle Lady told me that it would end the curse!

...Yoko? That crone! What are you playing at?

Wait...she want's the sister?

What, Sombria?

That old hag! She want's to kill us all before we end the curse.

W-What do you mean?

If she ends Sombria, Tena and I will be stuck like this forever!

I'll never get my life back!

That's not my problem, it's yours! I just want Sombria back! And I have to return home to do it, then so be it!

YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO US! I SAVED YOUR LIFE!

Pfft! As if! You should of thought about that before you kidnapped us.

Wait! Luzia, I-I know about your dreams...

The marketplace, the therapist...all of it.

It's a bond that we both share. I wasn't lying when I said we have met before.

You're lying! I've never seen you in my entire life, lady!

I-I wish you could just...remember.

Just give me back my sister...

please.

Sombria was easily drawn to me.

It's like we're one soul living in two bodies. I don't understand it myself but...

I wish I could explain it.

Luzia, whatever happens...

don't ever let your Sombria go...

or she'll share the same fate as my sister.

What are you talking about?!

Heh. Like I said, you're too young to understand...

but someday, you will.

Luzia, if you choose this path...

you're going to have to make a choice.

What choice?

To save your life, or Sombria's

Wait, why?! I can't save us both?!

If you choose to listen to her be warned...

this will not go the way you think.

Look! All I want is my sister back!

I want us to go home! So everything can go back to the way it was.

me too.

T-There's something still bugging me...

if you're not The Red Witch...

then who is?

It's yo-

Huh? What was that noise?

Finally! I found you.

Little sister.

Hiding in the bodies of the living, are we?

I have waited a very long time for this moment.

I've been hanging from your bathhouse wall...

thinking about all those years on how I could have spent my LIFE!

Tena, I'm sorr-

SHUT IT, ASHINA!

The time for forgiveness is over!

YOU TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME!

Please, Tena! Listen to me.

Luzia, is our chance to setting us free-

DON'T YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT FREEDOM!

You have no idea what it's like to have your damn legs cut off!

Then chained to a wall for an eternity!

This is all Yoko's fault!

Was it?! She told me everything, big sis!

About how pathetic I was, about how jealous you were of everything I had!

What's going on?

Go on, sis! Tell her another one of your famous lies!

Luzia, I-I-

Ha! Pathetic! You kidnapped a little girl and her sister to escape the curse without me!

You were going to leave me in that dark disgusting bathouse, forever!

So you are a liar!

Heh! You too, aye?

Typicall!

Leave these two out of this, Tena.

They are more than welcome to leave...

but you aren't going anywhere.

Luzia, please listen to what I've told you.

You can end this, you have to believe me!

Just keep Sombria safe!

Now go!

I'm trying to listen out for my-

OH, SHUT UP! YA OLD CAVE BAT!

YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE NOT HERE!

Hmmph! How rude!

Yes, Luzia! I'm here!

W-we need t-to go home-.

Yes, we do! And now we can! I can't believe you're-

I-I'm sorry, S-Sombie...

...home.

No, NO!

NO,NO,NO!

LUZIA! DON'T GO PLEASE!!!

*Giggle*

Syke!

A HA HA HA!

B-B-but, h-how?

I've been awake for the last couple of days now.

I just unplugged my heart machine cord, thingy.

ARHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

Geez, Sombie! Take it easy, It's just a prank.

A PRANK?!

I'LL SHOW YOU A PRANK!

Can you both please keep it down!

If you open your mouth again, I will choke you with your fluid cord!

Sombie, calm down.

I'm sorry, Luzia.

I-I was really scared, y'know.

Scared of what?

That you wouldn't wake up.

Duh, that's what happens after you sleep.

You wake up.

Luzia, I want to say I'm sorry for everything.

I just wanted to show mom I can be responsible...

and it seems like I failed both of you.

It's not your fault, Sombie.

It is, Luzia.

Just look what happened to you.

What did happen to me?

I guess they haven't told you yet.

You were in a coma for about three months.

You went to get a glass of milk but never came out of the kitchen.

Wait, milk? What about the kidnapping? The bathhouse?

Did I just dream it all?

What are you talking about, Luzia?

Bathhouse?

Yeah, and you were some freakiy lookin' ghost thing with long arms!

Dang, it must've been a dream.

Sounds like one heck of a dream though.

I'm just glad your ok!

It just didn't feel like a dream.

I swear!

Well, now that you're awak maybe I can see the nurse...

and we can get the heck outta here.

Hey, can we get some waffles?!

I've got a bad craving for some waffles!

Sure, just let me go see the nurse real quick, ok?

ACH_GOOD_ENDING

And that was the most sketchiest looking motel in Ash Pines.

I wish you'd just wake up, Luzia.

So we can go home...

please...

I can't stand to see you like this anymore.

I want my sister back...

m-my real sister back.

Please, if you can hear me...

Give me a sign.

It's been 3 months now!

You will wake up! I know it!

Please.

I'm so sorry Luzia!

Just please wake up!

I-I guess I'll just have to wait until you're ready.

*Sniff* I sure could use a smoke.

I'll be right back Luzia.

Mr. Gus always goes on about his drinking problem.

Mom said she'd be here soon.

I don't see what's taking her so long?

She works here for crying out loud.

*Sigh* Who am I kidding...

you can't hear me anyway.

Excuse me deary?

Can you please keep it down?

I'm waiting for my daughters to arrive and I can't hear them.

I'll keep it down.

Thank you.

I'll come back right after I have a smoke.

I-It's a giant doll?

RealVerd

That's a cute doll you have there.

Hey! Thanks!

Her name's Molly!

Heh, I know Verdinya.

Now, don't you loose her again, ok?

I won't, Sombria!

Please, call me Sombie.

Luzia always does.

How is Luzia, she's been here a for a long time now.

She's doing really well!

I hope.

I'm sure she'll wake up soon!

Then she can play with me and Molly!

You wanna play tea parties?

Sorry, Verd. I've got stuff to do.

Oh well, maybe next time.

RealButcher

Hey Sombs, hows it goin'?

Not so good.

Still worried about Luzia, eh?

She's a tough kid.

She'll be alright.

I hope so.

Still seeing the therapist?

Got no choice.

It's either this or jail.

What did you do this time?

Tried robbing a gas station, again.

I just couldn't do it in the end.

I scared the heck outta this kid standing next to me.

I just couldn't see the poor girl cry.

So, I gave her a candy bar and we chatted til the cops arrived.

That was nice of you, in a horrific kinda way.

Yeah, I guess!

Are you seeing him today?

I don't really want to see him anymore.

I don't blame ya, the guy's a creep!

Anyway, I'll probably be ready to go in soon.

Well, good luck in there.

I'll catch ya later, Sombs!

RealAshina

Hey! Can I ask you something?

Uh, sure?

Who does your hair?

It's so cute!

Uh, thanks.

My mom does it for me.

It's a traditional look, apparently.

Pfft! She looks more like a big mouse!

I don't know why you want to look like her, Ashina.

Don't mind her, she's just jealous!

More like you're jealous!

Yeah, right.

The only thing I would be jealous about is that you're taller than me!

She has really nice legs ya know?

See? Jealous!

Yes I know, you both fight about this every day.

You girls visiting your mother again?

How come your mother is a lot older than you two?

Well, she's not really our mother.

She's our grandmother.

Our mother died and she just took over.

You can thank her for that.

She died giving birth to her.

I'm sorry to hear that.

It's fine, we have a new mother now.

Yeah, whats left of her that is.

I'll catch up with you two later.

Okay, talk to you later.

I still love your hair!

I'm not in the mood for talking.

Talk to my sister, she never shuts up.

G-Gustoph?

RealGustoph

Ah! Sombria!

How's the little one?!

Not good, it's been 3 months now.

I'm not sure what's wrong with her.

I'm sorry to hear that, young one!

I wish all the best for your younger sibling!

Thanks, Gus.

How's everything with you?

Well, so far, everything is good!

I been hitting those tripple A meetings every week and the liver's getting back to her ol' self!

They say I can return back to work in a few days!

That's good news!

I'm proud of you, Gus!

I hope you can drive those trains again!

You're a very nice girl.

I'm sure your sister will be fine.

Now, time for a little *yawn* nap. *Zzz*

RealStretch

Hey.

Remember me?

O-Oh yes!

You're Sombria, right?

I sure am!

So, whatcha' doin', Stretch?

I'I'm just grabbing a soda from the machine.

the one at the hotel is-

Broken? I presume?

Y-Yes, how did you-

You tell me, like every day that it's broken.

I've also noticed that you never buy anything from it either.

O-Oh...

I b-buy snacks from the machine all the t-time!

Uh huh, sure.

Just remember I have a nice face too, Stretch.

*Blush* Was it really that obvious!?

I'm s-so sorry!

Ha! It's fine!

I've known for a while now.

G-Gosh! I f-feel like a complete idiot!

I should hide in a closet a-and never come out!

Well, you ain't gonna see no butt from in there.

But hey, just sayin'.

I promise I won't look at it anymore.

Pfft! C'mon, Stretch! I don't care if you do.

Just try talking to me, next time.

I don't bite, promise.

O-Ok.

*Blushing* Thanks, S-Sombria.

I used to come here all the time.

W-When I was upset.

You did?

Why were you upset for?

I-I just...get like that sometimes.

I can't explain it.

So, you're depressed?

Luzia, I've been like this for a very long time.

Does mom know?

I don't like to share it with anyone.

But you told me.

Who else have you told?

Just my therapist...

I basically tell him everything...

but he doesn't help.

Isn't he supposed to?

I guess, but he...

look, never mind.

You can tell me?

I-I can't. I'm sorry, Luzia.

I just need some time to myself, please.

Ok, well, I'm going to do some exploring.

Do you remember where the exit is?

I can't remember right now.

Okay, but don't go anywhere.

You can be depressed here, ok?

Lighten up Sombie! It's just a joke.

I'll be back soon.

Too bad I don't have any money!

Wait...

it smells like...

chocolate?

This seems so stupid.

What is that sound?

W-What are you?

*Shakes head*

Can you talk?

Can you understand me?

*Nods*

Okay, I need to reach the basement.

Is there a way down?

*Points to candy bar*

You want this?

Well, could you do me a favor?

I need to turn on the backup generator.

Where did you go?!

Hey! You did it!

Here you go! You've earnt it!

It's a long way down. I'd need a good enouh reason to throw this down there...

huh, it smells like...chocolate?

I-I can hear you in there.

I need to talk to you.

You know I can't do that, right?

You're my big sister!

I'm supposed to be around you to annoy you!

Y-You don't understand.

Luzia, you will never understand!

But Sombie...

I do understand.

I understand what it's like to be alone.

To have no one you can talk to.

To have no life left to live.

How could you possibly understand, you're only twelve.

It's because I have a connection with you, we're sisters after all.

You're not going to believe me, I know.

It's hard to, Luzia. This isn't the stuff someone your age would say, especially you!

That Ashina lady was right.

I have to protect you, Sombie.

To protect me from what?!

F-From...

killing yourself.

Killing myself?!

It's starting to make sense now.

Sombria, whatever is making you depressed, tell me!

I want to make you happier!

You're freaking me out, Luzia!

I-I'm just scared, Sombie!

I'm scared that I might lose you!

I was never going to!

I always never go through with it!

Sometimes, we do go through it...

but I know I can't stop you...

even though I tried to.

I know this is not my choice...

it's yours.

I can't save you...

but I will always be there for you, even if I'm not around.

We still have a shot to break this loop!

But you need to trust me...

please, Sombie.

Ok, I trust you.

We need to do this together.

I think you're right.

There's one thing though.

Whatever happens just promise me something.

Just remember that no matter what, you will always be my sister.

Luzia, thank you.

For everything.

So are you coming?

In a minute.

I sorta need to go while I'm in here anyway.

Okay, I'll meet you at the exit.

I found this doll.

I have friends y'know!

So what are you doing here?

My sister and I are trying to get home.

We just got off the train.

Train?

Trains haven't come through this subway for years!

Wait?!

How can you see me right now?!

You're alive?!

Maybe, I don't know.

So, you're a ghost huh?

I'm not a ghost!

I'm a girl!

I'm just a dead, little, girl!

What is your name?!

My name is Luzia, I think.

Luzia?

You know me already?

You're the witch!

You're the one that did this to us!

What?! Me?!

Yes! You witch!

I'm not a witch!

Am I?

Thanks to you, we're all stuck in this subway!

Don't act dumb with me!

You're The Red Witch!

WHAT?!

I'm not the witch!

You are!

You're just...

a little girl?

That's because I am not the witch!

All of us ghosts know who you are!

You can't lie to me!

Am I really the witch?

Does everyone hate me?

Because you left us all to die in this god forsaken subway!

All because of your stupid loop!

The loop?

You don't know your own story?

Damn! You really did lose your mind!

I-I don't remember anything.

The last thing I remember is waking up.

I couldn't sleep so I went to find Sombria.

I know Sombria!

She's the girl that comes here to cry!

To cry?

She comes here when she's-

Depressed?

Yeah, she does depress a lot, he he!

Are you going to trap her down here too?!

What are you talking about?

Do you know why your sister comes here all the time?!

Because she's depressed?

Ha!

No!

All of us have a tragic story of how we died.

Your sister is looking for hers too.

No, not Sombie.

You created this place to trap her and all of us here!

Just so you could keep her alive!

JUST LET HER DIE!!!

So we all can leave!

I-I can't, though.

You don't understand, she is my sister!

I don't understand?

I'M ALREADY DEAD!

I CAN'T MOVE ON! AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU!

*Sigh* Look, we all have to make choices that we don't like.

What would happen if she died?

We could all move on.

This loop thingy of yours would be broken.

Wait, that's how I break the loop? All she said was to go home-

You owe us!

We've suffered a lot longer than you have.

This is Sombria's home! So send her there!

I need to speak to Sombria.

I'll be back.

Well, I ain't goin' no where.

Thanks to you.

LastChance

So...

what's it gonna be? Witch!

I have made my decision.

And?

I'm going to break the loop.

Good! We finally made some progress!

I'm going to be free from this nightmare?!

Yes, we all will...

including my sister.

W-Wait?! What do you-

Please!

We have suffered enough!

I don't know if I am one who has caused all this...

but I do know, that I am the one to end it.

Let her die!

It's the only way!

there is another.

I just know there is.

FINE!

JUST LEAVE US HERE!

YOU WITCH!

Verd-

GO AWAY!

Before I go...

I thought you may want your doll back.

M-Molly?!

W-Where did you find her?!

Sombria found her.

I-I thought I lost her...

she fell onto the tracks...

I-I fell, onto the tracks.

How did you know she was mine?

I know what it's like to lose someone special.

We're just like you, y'know?

Trying to find a way home.

It looks like I was told a lie.

The old lady was wrong about you.

Old lady?

She talks about the story of the red witch all the time.

But she never mentioned you would be so...nice.

She told you I was The Red Witch?

She said \"only The Red Witch can break the loop.\"

But to break it, she must spill the blood of her sister.

I-I'm sorry for how I acted back there.

I've forgotten that I was once was alive.

I will break the loop, I promise.

Good luck, Luz-

What is it?

There's that laugh again.

Well, good luck Luzia!

Don't you remember me?

You're me?

I am the red witch, Luzia!

I am you!

So, you want to play games?

Fine.

I love to play games!

How about truth or dare?

W-What?

*Sigh* Truth or dare, you've heard of it before, right?

Ok, ok. Truth.

Playing it safe, huh?

Have you ever kissed a boy?

Ew! No.

Ha ha!

Ok, your turn.

Truth or-

Dare! Ha!

Watcha gonna do now?!

I-I don't know-

Well I dare you to kill me!

COME ON! KILL ME!

NO!

GO KILL YOURSELF!

Truth.

Why are you naked?

Because I've got nothing to hide.

Wait, isn't it my turn?

We've all had enough turns at this game.

I want you to end it.

Truth!

Am I really the red witch?

How do I end the loop?

Kill the one you created it.

TRUTH!

And who is that?

Dare.

Wait! I need to know-

I said, dare.

J-Just...

end me, please...

for Sombria.

Sombie has suffered enough and it's all because of me.

Ever since I was little all I ever did was get in her way, interrupt her life.

I don't deserve someone like her.

Go home.

Just go, now!

Self sacrifice...

a debt repaid.

Don't mess this up, Luzia...

a lot of lives are at steak.

ACH_FAKE_LUZIA

We made it!

Sombie! We're finally home!

Yes, we did...

It's good to finally see home again.

And now we can stop this cursed loop and bring you back to normal!

I-I hope so.

Are you feeling alright, Luzia?

I feel great! Just like pickles and beans!

Why? Aren't you feeling good, too?

O-Oh I am...

are you ok? You seem, different.

I've always been like this?

You seem, more child like.

Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!

Are you calling me dumb?!

N-No no, I didn't mean it like tha-

Well, you're ugly! And stupid!

You look like a giant freak!

Maybe, I am just a freak after all.

That's right! R-Run!

Ugh! My head!

BobbyPin2

Another bobby pin?

How many does Sombie need to keep those balls of hair up?

The ground is soft here.

If only I had a shovel.

It's the butcher's knife?

There's some writing on the handle.

Good luck kid! We're all countin' on ya!

Heh, he trusts me with knives now?

Y-Yeah, a little.

My poor darling.

Once you're done up there I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

Something wrong, Luzia?

You seem, shaken.

I-I'm fine, I think.

If you say so, my dear.

I'll wait here until you return.

I just want to say thanks...

for helping me understand Sombria.

Oh! You're very welcome, my dear.

I know what I have to do.

Where'd she go?!

The big cry baby!

It's cold outside.

The windows are frosting over.

That's enough imagination for me.

KillYoko

Hey, can I ask you something?

You can ask me anything, my dear.

Truth or dare?

This isn't the time to be playing gam...

Fine!

Why did you do it?

D-Do what?

Let your daughters go.

Luzia, you shouldn't be putting your nose into-

You lied to them, told them that everything was gonna be ok...

but it wasn't, was it?

You turned the other cheek!

How dare you! You little pest!

YOU TOOK THEM AWAY FROM ME!

BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD FOR NOTHING WITC-

ENOUGH OF YOUR GAMES!

This isn't a game.

BAH! TRUTH!

Do you still blame lil ol' me for your daughters?

YES! I BLAME YOU-

Then why didn't you stop them?

They asked you for help...

and what did you tell them?

I told them to ignore that man! He was nothing but trouble!

I don't care if they both liked him, you didn't have to take their lives away!

I didn't, you did.

You told them they were foolish, that men only use them to get what they want.

You lied to them.

You forced them to stay home, to cook and clean...

while you courted with the very same man they liked.

T-THAT'S NOT TRUE!

H-HOW DARE YOU ACUSE ME OF SUCH-

Enough of this pathetic game!

Your time is up, Luzia!

TRUTH OR DARE!

DARE!!!

What are you gonna do about that!

*Sniff* *Softly crying*

I d-dare..

I dare you..

WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU DARE ME TO DO?!

I dare you...

to die.

For all the lives you have ruined...

may you find piece, old hag.

I really could just go back to bed.

I've missed you so much!

Wow! I never thought I'd ever say that!

I feel...

so...sleepy...

NO! I can't go to sleep just yet!

I can't keep my eyes open...

I can't take it anymore...

Zzz.

It's mom's lucky screwdriver.

Say your prayers screws!

I always loved this picture.

My bow looks great!

Thanks, mom!

I'll let her stay in there until she wants to be nice to me.

Besides, it's locked anyway...

and awfully quiet?

H-Hey Sombie?

I just wanted to check on you.

No, not yet.

I'm still mad at her.

I'll come back in a little while.

I can't use it.

My laptop needs to be charged.

Sombie.

She's gone.

She told you didn't she?

She told you everything.

She did.

So what are you going to do now?

I have to do what is right.

Then do it.

Ok.

Where are you going?

I'm going to bed.

What do you mean you're going to bed?

Why won't you-

Because I don't have to.

I may be twelve but I can tell when a story is done.

I'll see you in the morning.

B-But h-how?

It's time for her to wake up, she did it.

The loop has been broken, you shall be free of this curse too.

So everything will go back to the way it was?

Not everything.

Luzia still needs to wake up.

The valley of sorrows shown you otherwise, didn't it?

Can you save her, Sombria?

I-I have to...

she saved me.

Besides, she's my little sister.

Thank you for playing My Big Sister.\n\n(press button to continue)

is this how your story ends?

I know you can get a better one! There's still time, a chance.

Jee, you're up early.

I wanted to *munch* eat some cereal!

I can see that.

Sooo...

about last night?

You mean this morning?

Yes, I mean this morning.

Yeah?

How did you know?

How did I know what?

How did you know how to break the-

Oh! *Munch* That!

See, what I did was *munch,munch,munch*

And then *munch,munch,munch*

Oh! I also,*munch,munch,munch*

And voila! *munch,munch,munch*

What kind of cereal are you eating anyway?

Crunchy hearts! What else!

Uh, why is the milk red?

What's that lump in the middle of the bowl?!

It's just cereal, okay! *Munch*

Jeez! *munch munch*

ACH_A_MOTHERS_HEART

Can you not talk with your mouth full.

It's disgusting!

There! Your majesty!

Now...

Before you say anything...

I want to say...

I love you, big sis.

And I love you too, y'little knuckle head!

If you tell anyone I said that, I'll kill you.

Yeah, sure.

Hey, listen...

do you wanna go grab some waffles or something at Daisy's?

AHHH! I haven't had waffles in ages!

You better not be lyin' to me!

Come on, go get ready.

I'm already ready!

ACH_A_HAPPY_ENDING

Hey! What are you doing in our house?!

Oh, me?

I thought I'd drop by...

see if you two made it back in one piece.

It took a forever! But we made it!

So, where's your sister?

Pffft, probably crying in her room.

Serves her right for calling me dumb!

Now that is not very sisterly, is it?

I don't care!

She should be nice to me!

Yes, she should.

That's right!

She should!

It's not like she appreciated me for helping her get home or anything!

And it was me who did everything!

Maybe we should remind her of your efforts, Luzia.

Yeah, maybe I should!

You go tell her how ungrateful she was for you help.

That she just got in your way.

She is going to get it!

Water goes on, water goes off.

Yep, that's a sink alright.

ACH_SINK

It's Sombie's mug.

It smells like ciggaretts.

Haha! The toaster.

I remember when Sombie caught her hands...

Wow...

That's not even funny anymore.

I don't need  to do that.

There's a picture on here.

It's the basement door.

The door looks like it's gonna fall off anyway.

The screws on the hinges are loose.

I can hear something.

It sounds like someone calling my name...

should I call back?

It's a mirror.

Basement Door

Mirror

I-Is s-someone there?

H-Hello?

Lu-Luzia?!

Is that really you!?

Wait a minute...

I-It's me...

it's-

MOM!

It's so g-good to see your face again, honey.

MOM!!!

What happened to you?!

I-I don't know. I woke up in here, it feels like it's been weeks...

maybe months.

W-Where is Sombria?

She's in her room, probably crying. Serves her right though!

She called me stupid! She said we were adopted! I just can't trust her anymore.

Luzia, I remember the first day I lay eyes on you...

I just knew that you were mine, your sister too.

Both you and Sombria arrived on my doorstep a very long time ago.

I don't know how or why, I guess it was just fate that brought us together.

you're not my mom?

I never said that, Luzia.

I will always be your mom.

Sombie too? W-Why, didn't you tell me?

I-I'm sorry, Luzia.

For all of it.

T-That bow of yours...

it's crooked.

It's how I like it.

It suits you.

T-Thanks...

no matter what happens to me.

always look out for your sister.

*sniff*

B-Because, she's all you have.

Luzia, I'll always love you.

I'm sorry, mom.

There's no need to be.

Just stick together...

and you'll be alright.

I haven't been my self lately.

I know.

I want to help, I really do...

but this stuff seems so complicated, she never wants my help.

She does, Luzia.

She can't tell you how she feels, but that's what's best about being sisters...

you already know.

Thanks...

mom.

It's time to go now. Luzia.

Your sister needs you.

I don't wanna let go.

I know...

Mom?

Mom?!

It's mom's gardening shovel.

...mom...

MomsHeart

It's been a while since we've been here.

Where are my damn waffles!

Hey, take it easy tiger.

I need waffles!

Sorry sis.

But I've been in a coma for like forever!

Okay, okay.

I see you're back to your normal self again.

No, I'm back to my hungry self.

WHERE ARE THESE DAMN WAFFLES?!

H-Hey, Luzia.

Can I show you something after breakfast?

It's sorta' my secret place to chill out.

It's not a boring place is it?

No way! It's got everything!

A swing, a great view and big ol' tree!

Does it have dinosaurs?

W-Well, no.

Then it doesn't have everything.

*Sigh* Lil' sis, I've missed you.

I've missed you too, Sombie...

and you're long arms.

TENA!!!

Huh? Who's that?

Tena!? You in here?

Where the heck is she?

No, way!

I-I,u-uh...hi.

We've already ordered, thanks.

Huh, what? Oh, no! I uh...

You ok?

Y-Yes! I'm just looking for my sister, Tena. You haven't seen her, have you?

Sorry, I thought you were the waiter. What does she look like?

Big hair, green sweater, sorta whatever attitude-

God dammit! I was holding that in the entire trip!

Next time, I'll just have one blueberry smoothie.

There you are, Tena!

Sorry, sis. I was bustin' for a pi-

You said you were coming to get a coffee to go?!

Oh, yeah! Thanks for reminding me!

Thanks for holding it for me. Cya!

Well, there she goes...again.

Glad she's ok, I hate it when my sister runs off like that.

Hey! I do not!

Little sisters, am I right?

Damn straight, sister! Ha!

I'm Ash, by the way.

I'm Sombria, and this is -

Actually, her name is Somba, but I like to call her Sombie.

It was nice to meet you both. Sorry, I have to go before Tena starts chatting up guys in the parking lot again.

Love your hair and your bow! Cya!

Oh! Luzia! Thanks for everything!

You're welcome!

What the heck, was all that about?

What was what?

That!

Actually, I'm not even going there, it's too early.

Where are my damned waffles!

Sorry sis, but I need something other than noodles!

Wow! I didn't think you'd ever get sick of food.

Hey now! I said noodles, not food!

You leave food alone!

Okay, okay, geez.

Yeah...

I know, Luzia.

I'm sorry about mom.

It's okay.

You couldn't help it.

I know she's still here.

Nagging us to brush our teeth and stuff.

Heh, maybe you to brush your teeth.

You mean, this whole time you were off the hook?!

I would have made you brush your teeth with the toilet brush!

Heh, it's good to have you back, Luzia.

And you too, big sis!

You know...

You still haven't told me how you figured all this out.

It's our little secret.

Our secret?

But you haven't told me?

No, not you.

The person behind the screen.

Okay, Luzia. Whatever you say.

Hey! After breakfast, I wanna show you something.

My little secret.

Okay, but it better not be a crab with a knife!

Those things are dangerous!

Luzia, you need to stop watching too much tv.

Think of what?

This place?

It's pretty neat...

it has a swing, so that's something.

Well, at least you're enjoying yourself.

I love coming here it helps me...

relax.

Too bad I can't keep coming here anymore.

How come?

Because I have to baby sit you now since Mom's been working more.

Hopefully now, we can enjoy it together.

Mhmm?

When I was in hospital, did you visit me every day?

Yep, I practically lived there.

Why did you keep coming back?

Pfft! Because you're my sister, silly!

Of course I'd be there for you...

whenever you need me.

There's something that I wanted to ask you.

In my dream you said something about us and mom.

That-

I know, Luzia. It's true.

It doesn't matter where we came from, it's about where we're going that matters.

Huh, I guess you're right.

I love this little family of ours.

So do I. I wouldn't change it for the world.

You still seeing that loser?

Who? Oh...

no.

I dumped him way back when you were admitted to hospital.

He was complaining I wasn't spendning any time with him because I was with you.

He could have come with you?

I offered but eh, his loss.

That guy from the motel seems to fancy you!

Y'know, the one that kept checking out your butt-

Don't ever change.

Pfft! Why would I?

But you have to promise me that we can stay up late and watch scary movies!

Every night!

I won't tell mom.

It's okay, I guess.

Heh.

This is my secret I was telling you about!

I used to come here everyday, after school.

It's so relaxing.

Lucky this place has a swing!

Otherwise it'd be boring!

Does anything please you, you're majesty?

Yeah, some things.

Like what?

Like stuff.

I dunno, dinosaurs and junk.

Do you think it's weird talking to your older sister?

Well yeah, a little.

You've never been this \"happy\" before.

Yeah, it's a little weird...

but I kinda like it, y'know?

So what's gonna happen now?

Well, I guess I'm gonna have to look after you...

seeing how moms-

I know, Sombie.

Don't worry, her heart will always be inside of me.

*Weird*

It'll be okay, though.

I have my big sis looking after me!.

I can stay up as late as I want!

Oh no you ain't!

If you disobey me, you're living with aunt Claire!

WHAT?! NO!

She lives in that creepy lookin' house!

Besides, she'll make me sleep with cousin Mark and he's a weirdo.

That boy's never been the same since uncle Robert left.

Hey, Luzia.

Calm down. I'm just kidding.

You better be!

Wait, how are we gonna pay for stuff?

You don't have a job!

It's fine, Luzia. I've been talking to the owner at Tanto's about some work.

You mean the Chinese restaurant?

Can you get me free fortune cookies?

Ha! We'll see.

I haven't got the job yet, I just spoke with the owner yesterday.

He did seem quite interested though, hopefully I'll have a job by next week.

How much does it pay?

It's not much, but enough to-

Wait, why are you asking questions like that?

You're twelve for crying out loud!

Need to know for christmas!

It's gonna be a tough year ahead, Luzia.

But we'll manage.

Well with a big sis like you...

I know we definitely will!

Huh, Luzia. That bow of yours is crooked.

Just the way I like it!

Ha! Never change, Luzia.
